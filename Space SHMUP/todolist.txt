FIX ASAP:
more bass in level 5
scene 1 has new background!!!

FIX After ASAP:
update when planet leaves
fade text out over longer period
bazooka messes up score????

FIX Before Open Beta:
Lock levels
Update tutorial
update scores in store
checks for free- background covers some of ship

FIX Before Launch
add new music, bartok
on application pause
fix permissions!

FIX at Some Point:
Show multiple highest scores per level
tell the user about the store
combine redundant parts of hero and main
ZAPPER!
add bouncing icon to tutorial
ComboPopText is wrong - enemy4 can't combo
use time.timescale? to do countdown from pause
ship stopped tilting
privatize your variables
pause - count down to re-enter
is thumpette good for this game?
get rid of all weapon counting - use same number if weapon is changed
object pooling
show hero ship on purchase screen?
survival mode - infinite number of waves
-shepard tone
consider moving stars
- maybe show movement somehow?
Add lightening strike to enemy?
add fire to back of ship; increase with speed upgrade
add restart button to game paused


UPGRADES - stronger shields, require two hits to destroy
magnet to pull in powerup
new ship
side shots
Missile that go out then home in
more new weapons, rockets go to nearest enemy and make big explosion, weapon that doesn't move, like a mine, add rocket fire
-double tap for rocket
faster shots, less delay between shots, more damage

cd C:\Users\HMGSYS\Documents\GitHub\Unity\Space-SHMUP\Space SHMUP
