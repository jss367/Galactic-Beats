FIX ASAP:
CHANGE SOOMLA TO PRODUCTION

FIX at Some Point:
use anchors for fireworks, enemies, asteroids
triple shoot is so powerful, try double shoot
new enemy!
Show multiple highest scores per level
tell the user about the store
combine redundant parts of hero and main
ZAPPER!
add bouncing icon to tutorial
use time.timescale? to do countdown from pause
ship stopped tilting
privatize your variables
pause - count down to re-enter
get rid of all weapon counting - use same number if weapon is changed
object pooling
show hero ship on purchase screen?
survival mode - infinite number of waves
-shepard tone
- maybe show movement somehow?
add fire to back of ship; increase with speed upgrade
add restart and level select buttons to game paused


UPGRADES - stronger shields, require two hits to destroy
magnet to pull in powerup
new ship
side shots
Missile that go out then home in
more new weapons, rockets go to nearest enemy and make big explosion, weapon that doesn't move, like a mine, add rocket fire
-double tap for rocket
faster shots, less delay between shots, more damage
