cool alien ships?
add rocket fire

easy:
: The variable popText of AsteroidAngle has not been assigned.

med:
pause button with count down to re-enter
set up combo!
show stars being awarded at game end
FIX SHIELD UPGRADE
angle asteroids ignoring shield, hitting player
boss scene in level 10?
destroy all game objects on end
add settings with volume
using too many resources
fix image on google play
make hero shots cooler
fire rate in enemy and enemy weapon
enemy4 can't combo
blackhole level - use atmosphere to make planet look like it's being destroyed
make a tutorial
don't declare victory until all game objects gone
reveal globes on at a time
a couple spread shots got stuck
weapon that doesn't move, like a mine

long:

object pooling
Multipliers for combos, do in different color
make player blink when hit


start user with some coins:
		public void onSoomlaStoreInitialized() {
			
			// some usage examples for add/remove currency
            // some examples
            if (StoreInfo.Currencies.Count>0) {
                try {
					StoreInventory.GiveItem(StoreInfo.Currencies[0].ItemId,4000);
					SoomlaUtils.LogDebug("SOOMLA ExampleEventHandler", "Currency balance:" + StoreInventory.GetItemBalance(StoreInfo.Currencies[0].ItemId));
                } catch (VirtualItemNotFoundException ex){
                    SoomlaUtils.LogError("SOOMLA ExampleEventHandler", ex.Message);
                }
            }

			ExampleWindow.GetInstance().setupItemsTextures();
		}
