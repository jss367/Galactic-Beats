Before Deploy:

combine redundant parts of hero and main
add restart button to game paused
tell the user about the store
levels are too similar
fade text out over longer period
allow new missile as powerup
magnet to pull in powerup
small enemies attach to you like barnicles
turn bazooka art off in the beginning
missile launcher still on ship - remove it if no missile in play
bazooka messes up score????
