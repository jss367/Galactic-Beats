Before Deploy:


ZAPPER!
combine redundant parts of hero and main
add restart button to game paused
tell the user about the store
levels are too similar
fade text out over longer period
on application pause
bazooka messes up score????


=======
add new music, bartok
update when planet leaves
add bouncing icon to tutorial
ComboPopText is wrong - enemy4 can't combo
use time.timescale? to do countdown from pause
is thumpette good for this game?
get rid of all weapon counting - use same number if weapon is changed
fix permissions!
pause - count down to re-enter
make hero shots cooler
fire rate in enemy and enemy weapon
ship stopped tilting
privatize your variables

long:
object pooling
magnet to pull in powerup
show hero ship on purchase screen?

upgrade - stronger shields, require two hits to destroy
new ship
side shots
more new weapons, rockets go to nearest enemy and make big explosion, weapon that doesn't move, like a mine, add rocket fire
-double tap for rocket
faster shots, less delay between shots, more damage

cd C:\Users\HMGSYS\Documents\GitHub\Unity\Space-SHMUP\Space SHMUP

build process:

other ideas:
small enemies attach to you like barnicles

optimized levels:

three waves - say wave one of three

survival mode - infinite number of waves
-shepard tone

consider moving stars
- maybe show movement somehow?
